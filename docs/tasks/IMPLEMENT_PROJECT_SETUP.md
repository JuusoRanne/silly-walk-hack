# Task: Implement Initial Project Setup

**Workflow Reference:** When implementing this task, adhere to the general procedure outlined in #file:docs/instructions/agent_workflow.md.

**Project Specification Reference:** #file:docs/specifications/PROJECT_SPEC.md
**Architecture Reference:** #file:docs/specifications/ARCHITECTURE.md
**README.md References:** Section 6 (How to Get Started), Section 7 (Security Robustness)
**Target Directory:** `silly-walk-hack/` (repository root) and `silly-walk-hack/app/`
**Assigned Role:** Backend Developer / DevOps Engineer

## Goal
Set up the initial project structure and configuration for "The Silly Walk Grant Application Orchestrator" using Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite as defined in our project specifications. This task focuses on creating the directory structure, dependency management, and essential base files to enable further development of specific features.

## Specific Requirements & Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Project Structure Setup

Create the following directory structure as specified in #file:docs/specifications/PROJECT_SPEC.md:

```
app/
├── main.py                  # Application entry point
├── models/
│   ├── application.py       # SQLAlchemy models
│   └── schemas.py           # Pydantic schemas
├── routes/
│   └── application_routes.py # API endpoints
├── services/
│   ├── application_service.py # Business logic
│   └── scoring_service.py    # Silliness scoring algorithm
├── db/
│   ├── database.py          # Database connection
│   └── repository.py        # Data access layer
├── auth/
│   └── api_key_auth.py      # API key authentication
└── utils/
    ├── security.py          # Security utilities
    └── error_handlers.py    # Custom error handlers
```

### 2. Dependency Management

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file at the repository root with the following dependencies:
   - fastapi
   - uvicorn[standard]
   - sqlalchemy
   - pydantic[email]
   - python-multipart (for form data)
   - python-dotenv (for environment variable management)
   - pytest (for testing)

2. Create a `.env.example` file at the repository root with placeholder values for configuration, including:
   - `API_KEY` (for API authentication)
   - `DATABASE_URL` (SQLite connection string)
   - Other relevant configuration variables

3. Add a `.gitignore` file that excludes:
   - Python artifacts (*.pyc, __pycache__, etc.)
   - Environment files (.env)
   - Local database files (*.db, *.sqlite)
   - Virtual environment directories

### 3. Base Application Setup

1. **main.py**: Create the FastAPI application entry point that:
   - Initializes the FastAPI app with proper metadata
   - Configures CORS middleware
   - Registers routers from the routes module
   - Sets up exception handlers
   - Includes a basic health check endpoint (`GET /health`)
   - Configures API documentation (Swagger UI, ReDoc)

2. **db/database.py**: Create the database connection setup that:
   - Defines the SQLAlchemy engine, session management, and Base class
   - Provides a dependency function for database session injection
   - Initializes tables on application startup

3. **auth/api_key_auth.py**: Implement API key authentication:
   - Define a dependency function for validating API keys
   - Load the API key from environment variables
   - Implement secure comparison of API keys
   - Return appropriate HTTP 401/403 errors for invalid keys

4. **utils/error_handlers.py**: Create custom exception handlers that:
   - Handle common exceptions (validation errors, not found, etc.)
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Ensure error responses don't leak sensitive information

### 4. Basic Application Models

1. **models/application.py**: Create the SQLAlchemy model for Application:
   - Define the Base Application class with the fields outlined in #file:README.md Section 3
   - Include proper column types, constraints, and relationships

2. **models/schemas.py**: Create the initial Pydantic models:
   - Define base schemas for request validation and response serialization
   - Include proper field validation, constraints, and examples for OpenAPI documentation

### 5. Minimal Implementation of Routes and Services

1. **routes/application_routes.py**: Create a router with skeleton endpoints:
   - Define but don't fully implement the POST and GET endpoints
   - Include proper route decorators with documentation, status codes, and dependencies

2. **services/scoring_service.py**: Create the structure for the scoring service:
   - Define the function signature for calculating silliness scores
   - Include docstrings and type hints
   - Leave actual implementation for a future task

### 6. Documentation Setup

1. Create a directory structure for OpenAPI documentation:
   - Create the `docs/api/` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Add an empty `openapi.yaml` file that will be populated in later tasks

### 7. Tests Structure

1. Create a basic test directory structure:
   - Add a `tests/` directory at the repository root
   - Include subdirectories for unit tests, integration tests, etc.
   - Add a basic `conftest.py` with pytest fixtures

## Implementation Guidance

1. **Security Focus:**
   - Follow best practices for Python/FastAPI security
   - Ensure API key validation is robust
   - Use parameterized queries via SQLAlchemy

2. **Documentation:**
   - Add comprehensive docstrings to all modules, classes, and functions
   - Ensure FastAPI route decorators include descriptions for OpenAPI generation

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement centralized error handling that doesn't leak implementation details
   - Use proper HTTP status codes for different error conditions

4. **Modularity:**
   - Design components with loose coupling for easier testing and maintenance
   - Use dependency injection for services and database access

The implementation should provide a solid foundation for adding specific feature implementations (endpoints, scoring algorithm, etc.) in subsequent tasks.
